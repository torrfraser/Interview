	   			<summary>1. Why do you want to design?</summary>
	   	    <p> I always loved to analyze logos, buy things that I don't need just because i liked the packaging, make drawings and paintings. But above it all, creating somehting of your own, create something that you can look back and be proud or see your design in a poster or billboard for example, there is something about that kind of gratification that interests me.</p>

	   	    	<summary>3. What is difficult within design and how do
	   	           you work to push past that?</summary>
	   	        <p3> The beginning of the projects is usually frustrating when I have no ideas for what i'll be doing. To push through that moment I usually start sketchingrandom things related to the project, do some research on the topic and at some point, an idea or an interesting sketch will be formulated.</p3>

	   	    	<summary>4. Can design change the world?</summary>
	   	    <p4> Absolutely. Everything that you is a product of design; from Uncle Sam'sposters to brick tiles on a sidewalk, without design nothing would really exist as we know. Therefore, design has already changed the world in the past. Yesterday's design changed the world for someone, and it will change it again for someone else tomorrow.</p4>

	   	    <p7> A website is a place in a world called the Web, these places have different information; different families that live in that place and they are connected by roads called weblinks that you find in a bigger website, i.e. google, which would be considered a city following this logic.</p7>
